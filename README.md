# PyArduinoCMD
Control Arduino via USB.

## What's that? ðŸ¤”
PyArduinoCMD is designed to be a small, portable program. It allows you to connect to an Arduino device of any kind and retrieve information from the computer.
For automation, you can create a .txt format script with a sequence of strings and pauses within it to execute.
You can also send strings individually or reset Arduino without interacting with the 'reset' button.

## Windows only for now! ðŸªŸ

## How to run ðŸš€
**Download the executable and run.**
Alternatively, you can compile the program with 'pyinstaller' and install the required libraries.
